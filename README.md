# My Curriculum Vitae

## TL;DR

I write my CV by `Latex`, which I'm comftable with. To re-generate the pdf files just add the `credential-data.sh` file with the following variables, then run `$ ./generate.sh` command.

```
#!/bin/bash

CREDENTIAL_PHONE_NUMBER='...'
CREDENTIAL_ADDRESS='...'
CREDENTIAL_PARVIZI_MAILTO='...'
CREDENTIAL_PARVIZI_EMAIL='...'
CREDENTIAL_ARIAI_MAILTO='...'
CREDENTIAL_ARIAI_EMAIL='...'
CREDENTIAL_BENAM_MAILTO='...'
CREDENTIAL_BENAM_EMAIL='...'
```


To generate the pdf files you may need to install xelatex and some fonts.
